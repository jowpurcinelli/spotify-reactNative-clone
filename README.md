# spotify-reactNative-clone
Autoral project to create a Music App with a friendly interface. (Maybe some back-end aswell) Using React Native.

The first idea started like that. Now I'm projecting to create a portifolio app for my personal friend, to share his Musics and videos.
Gonna be using a lot from this app...
